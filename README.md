# 🌐 Web Dev Journey

Welcome to my **Web Development Journey** — a growing collection of beginner-friendly projects created as I learn HTML, CSS, and frontend development through a *learning by building* approach.

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained project that focuses on a specific concept, from styling basics to layout techniques and creative HTML applications.
